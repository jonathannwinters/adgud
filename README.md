Acitive Directory Group User Details powershell GUI

Rudimentary but Helpful Graphical Tool to Get List of Groups and Member Users.
Edit the code's list of groups/departments so that it includes the names of the groups you would like to be able to quickly pull up. Future editions will auto pull group/department names or allow for searching for group names. Also note, this mini-app does not yet recurse.

To run, right click the powershell script file named AGDUD.ps1 and click Run with PowerShell.
